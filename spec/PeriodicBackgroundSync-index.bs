Introduction {#intro}
=====================

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Web Applications often run in environments with unreliable networks (e.g., mobile phones) and unknown lifetimes (the browser might be killed or the user might navigate away).
  This makes it difficult for web apps to keep their content and state in sync with servers.
  
  This API is intended to reduce the time between content creation and content synchronization between the servers and the web app. It does so by letting the web app register an intent to periodically synchronize state and data, with a minimum interval it wishes to do so at. Through a service worker event, the user agent then periodically lets the web app download network resources and update state.

  As this API relies on service workers, functionality provided by this API is only available in a [=secure context=].

  ## Example ## {#example}
  Requesting a [=periodic Background Sync opportunity=] at a mininimum interval of one day from a [=browsing context=]:

  <pre class="lang-js">
    async function registerPeriodicNewsCheck() {
      const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;
      try {
        await registration.periodicSync.register('fetch-news', {
          minInterval: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
        });
      } catch {
        console.log('Periodic Sync could not be registered!');
      }
    }
  </pre>

  Reacting to a <code>periodicsync</code> event within a [=service worker=]:

  <pre class="lang-js">
    self.addEventListener('periodicsync', event => {
      event.waitUntil(fetchAndCacheLatestNews());
    });
  </pre>

  In the above example <code>fetchAndCacheLatestNews</code> is a developer-defined function is a developer-defined function that fetches the latest news articles from a server and stores them locally, for example using the {{Cache}} API, for offline consumption.

Concepts {#concepts}
========================

The <code>periodicsync</code> event is considered to run <dfn>in the background</dfn> if no [=service worker clients=] whose [=frame type=] is top-level or auxiliary exist for the origin of the corresponding service worker registration.

The user agent is considered to be [=online=] if the user agent has established a network connection. A user agent MAY use a stricter definition of being [=online=]. Such a stricter definition MAY take into account the particular [=service worker=] or origin a [=periodicsync registration=] is associated with.

A <dfn>periodic Background Sync opportunity</dfn> allows periodic synchronization between the server and the web app, the exact interval of which is decided by the user agent. This can be requested through {{PeriodicSyncManager}}.

Constructs {#constructs}
=========================

A [=service worker registration=] has an associated <dfn>list of periodicsync registrations</dfn> whose element type is a [=periodicsync registration=].

A <dfn>periodicsync registration</dfn> is a tuple consisting of a [=tag=], a dictionary of options, a <dfn>time to fire</dfn> and a [=registration state=].

The <dfn>tag</dfn> is a {{DOMString}}. Within one [=list of periodicsync registrations=] each [=periodicsync registration=] MUST have a unique [=tag=]. Periodic Background Sync doesn't share namespace with Background Sync, so an origin can have registrations of both types with the same tag.

The options are a dictionary containing [=minInterval=], a long long. <dfn>minInterval</dfn> is used to specify the minimum interval, in milliseconds, at which the periodic synchronization should happen. [=minInterval=] is a suggestion to the user agent. The actual interval at which <code>periodicsync</code> events are fired MUST be greater than or equal to this.
Enclosing options in a dictionary allows this spec to be extended with more options in the future without adversely affecting existing usage.

The [=time to fire=] is the soonest time decided by the user agent at which it is appropriate to fire the next <periodicsync> event for the [=periodicsync registration=].

The <dfn>registration state</dfn> is one of <dfn>pending</dfn>, <dfn>waiting</dfn>, <dfn>firing</dfn>, or <dfn>reregisteredWhileFiring</dfn>. It is initially set to [=pending=].

Privacy Considerations {#privacy}
==================================

## Permission ## {#permission}
Periodic Background Sync is only available if the {{PermissionState}} for a {{PermissionDescriptor}} with {{name}} <code>"periodic-background-sync"</code> is {{granted}}. In addition, user agents SHOULD offer a way for the user to disable periodic background sync.

## Location Tracking ## {#location-tracking}
Fetch requests within the <code>periodicsync</code> event while [=in the background=] may reveal the client's IP address to the server after the user has left the page. The user agent SHOULD limit tracking by capping the number of retries and duration of <code>periodicsync</code> events, to reduce the amount of time the user's location can be tracked by the website. Further, the user agent SHOULD limit persistent location tracking by capping the frequency of <code>periodicsync</code> events, both for an origin, and across origins.

## History Leaking ## {#history-leaking}
Fetch requests within the <code>periodicsync</code> event while [=in the background=] may reveal something about the client's navigation history to middleboxes on networks different from the one used to create the [=periodicsync registration=]. For instance, the client might visit site https://example.com, which registers a <code>periodicsync</code> event, but based on the implementation, might not fire until after the user has navigated away from the page and changed networks. Middleboxes on the new network may see the fetch requests that the <code>periodicsync</code> event makes. The fetch requests are HTTPS so the request contents will not be leaked but the domain may be (via DNS lookups and IP address of the request). To prevent this leakage of browsing history, the user agent MAY choose to only fire <code>periodicsync</code> events on the network the [=periodicsync registration=] was made on, with the understanding that it will reduce usability by not allowing synchronization opportunistically.

API Description {#api-description}
===================================
## Extensions to the {{ServiceWorkerGlobalScope}} interface ## {#serviceworkerglobalscope-extension}
<script type="idl">
partial interface ServiceWorkerGlobalScope {
    attribute EventHandler onperiodicsync;
};
</script>

## Extensions to the {{ServiceWorkerRegistration}} interface## {#service-worker-extensions}

<script type="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
partial interface ServiceWorkerRegistration {
  readonly attribute PeriodicSyncManager periodicSync;
};
</script>

A {{ServiceWorkerRegistration}} has a <dfn>periodic sync manager</dfn> (a {{PeriodicSyncManager}}), initially a new {{PeriodicSyncManager}} whose [=service worker registration=] is the [=context object=]'s [=service worker registration=]. The <code>periodicSync</code> attribute's getter must return the [=context object=]'s [=periodic sync manager=].

## {{PeriodicSyncManager}} interface ## {#periodicsyncmanager-interface}
<script type="idl">
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface PeriodicSyncManager {
    Promise<void> register(DOMString tag, optional BackgroundSyncOptions options);
    Promise<sequence<DOMString>> getTags();
    Promise<void> unregister(DOMString tag);
};

dictionary BackgroundSyncOptions {
    [EnforceRange] unsigned long long minInterval = 0;
};
</script>

The <code><dfn method for=PeriodicSyncManager title="register(tag, options)">register(<var>tag</var>, <var>options</var>)</dfn></code> method, when invoked, MUST return <a>a new promise</a> <var>promise</var> and run the following steps <a>in parallel</a>:

1. Let <var>serviceWorkerRegistration</var> be the {{PeriodicSyncManager}}'s associated [=service worker registration=].
1. If |serviceWorkerRegistration|â€™s [=active worker=] is null, [=reject=] |promise| with an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these steps.
1. if the {{PermissionState}} for a {{PermissionDescriptor}} with {{name}} <code>"periodic-background-sync"</code> is not {{granted}}, [=reject=] |promise| with a {{NotAllowedError}} and abort these steps.
1. Let <var>isBackground</var> be true.
1. For each <var>client</var> in the [=service worker clients=] for the |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s origin:
1. If |client|'s [=frame type=] is top-level or auxiliary, set |isBackground| to false.
1. If |isBackground| is true, [=reject=] |promise| with an {{InvalidAccessError}} and abort these steps.
1. Let <var>currentRegistration</var> be the [=periodicsync registration=] in |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s [=list of periodicSync registrations=] whose [=tag=] equals <var>tag</var> if it exists, else null.
1. If |currentRegistration| is null:
    1. Let |newRegistration| be a new [=periodicSync registration=].
    1. Set |newRegistration|'s associated [=tag=] to |tag|.
    1. Set |newRegistration|'s associated [=options=] to |options|.
    1. Set |newRegistration|'s associated [=service worker registration=] to |serviceWorkerRegistration|.
    1. Add |newRegistration| to |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s [=list of periodicsync registrations=].
    1. Calculate an appropriate <var>timeToFire</var> for |newRegistration| based on the [=minInterval=] value of |options|, and any other considerations the user agent has implemented per recommendations in [[#privacy]] and Resource Usage. The time interval between now and |timeToFire| MUST be greater than or equal to the [=minInterval=] specified in |options|. Set the |newRegistration|'s [=time to fire=] to |timeToFire|.
    1. [=Resolve=] |promise|.
1. Else:
    1. If |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s [=registration state=] is [=waiting=], set <var>currentRegistration</var>'s [=registration state=] to [=pending=].
    1. If |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s [=registration state=] is [=firing=],
        1. Set |serviceWorkerRegistration|'s [=registration state=] to [=reregisteredWhileFiring=].
        1. If the |currentRegistration|'s [=options=] are different from |options|:
            1. Set |currentRegistration|'s associated [=options=] to |options|.
            1. Calculate an appropriate <var>timeToFire</var> for |currentRegistration| based on the [=minInterval=] value of |options|, and any other considerations the user agent has implemented per recommendations in [[#privacy]] and Resource Usage. The time interval between now and |timeToFire| MUST be greater than or equal to the [=minInterval=] specified in |options|. Set the |currentRegistration|'s [=time to fire=] to |timeToFire|.
    1. [=Resolve=] |promise|.
